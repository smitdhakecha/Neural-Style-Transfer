# Neural-Style-Transfer

Neural style transfer is a technique in which we take three images. <br>1. **A content image** <br>2. **A style reference image** (such as an artwork by a famous painter),  <br> 3. **The input image you want to style**  <br>
<br>
We blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image. <br>
<br>
Input image is generally a random image and we use the suitable optimization technique to reduce the loss between **input image and content image** as well as the loss between **input image and style image** to get the desired artistic image.
